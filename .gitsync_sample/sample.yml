  #Strategy to update target
  #  update (Default)
  #   - On this strategy the process will update target branch and push:
  #     git pull -> sync -> git add/update -> git push
  #     Target branch should push from remote (without PR)
  #
  #  create-branch
  #   - On this strategy the process will create a new branch and push differences to it.
  #     If the branch already exist, it will be updated.
  #     This strategy is usefull to manually create a PR to update another branch (like develop, main)
